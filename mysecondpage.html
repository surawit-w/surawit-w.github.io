    <h1>The Secret</h1>
    <h2>By Rhonda Byrne</h2>
    <p>The Secret is a self-help book about the power of positive thinking by
       Rhonda Byrne. The book is based on a pseudo-scientific theory called
       the “law of attraction” – the principle that “like attracts like.”
       Specifically, Byrne focuses on the idea that your dreams do in
       fact come true – thinking about money and wealth will attract these
        very things, causing them to manifest in your life. Likewise, fretting
        over a worst-case scenario will only cause your fears to be realized.
        Hence the importance of positive thinking. There are no accidents and
        bad luck. Instead, Byrne writes, “Your life right now is a reflection
        of your past thoughts.”</p>
